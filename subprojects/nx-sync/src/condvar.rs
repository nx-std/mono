/// A Condition Variable
///
/// Condition variables represent the ability to block a thread such that it
/// consumes no CPU time while waiting for an event to occur. Condition
/// variables are typically associated with a boolean predicate (a condition)
/// and a mutex. The predicate is always verified inside of the mutex before
/// determining that a thread must block.
///
/// Functions in this module will block the current **thread** of execution.
/// Note that any attempt to use multiple mutexes on the same condition
/// variable may result in a runtime panic.
