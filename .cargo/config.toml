# This file configures Cargo's behavior for this project.

[build]
# Set the default target platform for `cargo build`.
# This is for the Nintendo Switch, using a freestanding (no-std) environment.
# For more information on this target, see:
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/aarch64-nintendo-switch-freestanding.html
target = ["aarch64-nintendo-switch-freestanding"]

# Override the default target directory for build artifacts.
# This places all compiled files in `buildDir/cargo-target` instead of the default `target/`.
# NOTE: The justfile passes `--target-dir` explicitly, which overrides this setting.
# This serves as a fallback when cargo is invoked directly (not through just tasks).
target-dir = "buildDir/cargo-target"

[unstable]
# This section enables unstable Cargo features.

# The `build-std` feature allows Cargo to recompile parts of the standard library.
# This is necessary for custom targets like `aarch64-nintendo-switch-freestanding`
# which don't have a pre-built standard library.
# We are building `core`, `compiler_builtins`, and `alloc`.
# See:
#  - https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std
#  - https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std-features
build-std = ["core", "compiler_builtins", "alloc"]
build-std-features = ["compiler-builtins-mem"]

# The `unstable-options` flag is required to use other unstable options,
# like `build-std`. It also allows passing unstable options to rustc.
# See: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html#output-options
unstable-options = true

# Compilation profiles configuration for Nintendo Switch homebrew.
# These profiles are configured to work optimally with the freestanding
# target and custom panic handler implementation.

[profile.dev]
# Use abort panic strategy for smaller binaries and compatibility with no_std environment.
# This is required for custom panic handlers and the Nintendo Switch homebrew environment.
panic = "abort"

[profile.release]
# Use abort panic strategy for smaller binaries and compatibility with no_std environment.
# This is required for custom panic handlers and the Nintendo Switch homebrew environment.
panic = "abort"
